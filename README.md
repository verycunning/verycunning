# Hi there, I'm Charles Cunningham (@verycunning)! ðŸ‘‹

**Founder & Chief Architect of The Tabbre Project | Pioneering Sustainable Energy and Global Economic Equity**

---

I'm a seasoned **Senior Technical Architect and Enterprise Architecture Leader** with over three decades of experience at the forefront of designing and delivering complex, scalable, and secure enterprise systems across diverse sectors including central government, financial services, and critical national infrastructure. My career has been defined by a passion for leveraging deep technology to solve large-scale challenges and drive meaningful impact.

Currently, my focus is entirely on **The Tabbre Project** â€“ an ambitious initiative to address the global climate crisis and eradicate poverty simultaneously.

## The Tabbre Project: A New Era of Abundance

At Tabbre, we are developing **oceanic floating solar farms** powered by cutting-edge perovskite photovoltaic technology and **AI-driven autonomous operations**. Our goal is to produce clean, storable energy (hydrogen, ammonia, methane) at a cost so low it will fundamentally outcompete fossil fuels, driving a market-led transition to sustainable energy.

Central to this vision is a revolutionary **dual-cryptocurrency ecosystem**. **TABB** is our deflationary governance and investment token, and **BRE** is our energy-backed stablecoin designed to become a global reserve currency, funding a **Universal Basic Income (GUBI)** worldwide. This unique model empowers us to:

*   **Decarbonise the planet** by making green energy the most economically viable choice.
*   **Fight global poverty** through equitable wealth distribution via the GUBI.
*   **Establish a self-sovereign, decentralised global financial system** anchored to real-world energy production.

## My Expertise

My work on The Tabbre Project draws heavily on my extensive background in:

*   **Enterprise, Solution & Blockchain Architecture:** Designing resilient and scalable systems (TOGAF, ArchiMate, Solidity, EVM chains, Cosmos SDK).
*   **Deep Tech Innovation:** From disaster recovery strategies for global energy giants to next-generation DEX designs and SEC-compliant tokenisation platforms.
*   **AI & Automation Strategy:** Architecting systems that leverage artificial intelligence for autonomous operations and hyper-efficiency.
*   **Strategic Leadership:** Building and mentoring high-performing technical teams, and securing significant multi-million-pound contracts through architectural vision.
*   **Financial Services & Government Transformation:** Delivering critical national infrastructure and complex financial systems.
